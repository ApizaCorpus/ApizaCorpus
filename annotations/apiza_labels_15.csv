2,1,Apiza,Hello! ,BE-POSITIVE,0,POS,,,
2,2,Apiza,"I am Apiza, a virtual assistant designed to help you navigate and use APIs. ",INFORM,,,,,
2,3,Apiza,How can I help?,ELICIT-OFFER-OR-SUGGESTION,,,,,
3,4,Programmer,What is the definition of structure of ALLERGO_EVENT,ELICIT-INFORM,,,structure basic,,
4,5,Programmer,?,OTHER,4,CONT,,,
5,6,Apiza,I found the following description for ALLEGRO_EVENT:\n\n,INFORM,4,POS,quality structure basic,,
5,7,Apiza,"An ALLEGRO_EVENT is a union of all builtin event structures, i.e. it is an object large enough to hold the data of any event type. ",INFORM,6,CONT,quality structure basic,,
5,8,Apiza,All events have the following fields in common:\n\ntype (ALLEGRO_EVENT_TYPE)\n\tIndicates the type of event.\nany.source (ALLEGRO_EVENT_SOURCE *)\n\tThe event source which generated the event.\nany.timestamp (double)\n\tWhen the event was generated.,INFORM,7,CONT,quality structure basic,,
6,9,Programmer,What are the possible values for ALLERGO_EVENT_TYPE,ELICIT-INFORM,8,FOL,structure,,
7,10,Programmer,And ALLERGO_EVENT_SOURCE,ELICIT-INFORM,9,FOL,structure,,
8,11,Apiza,"ALLERGO_EVENT_TYPE is an enum with several values, including ALLEGRO_EVENT_JOYSTICK_AXIS , ALLEGRO_EVENT_KEY_DOWN , and ALLEGRO_EVENT_MOUSE_AXES. There are 30 different values in total. ",INFORM,10,,structure,,
8,12,Apiza,Are you looking for one type in particular?,ELICIT-INFORM,,,structure,,
9,13,Apiza,I found the following description of ALLEGRO_EVENT_SOURCE:\n\n,INFORM,,,concepts patterns,,
9,14,Apiza,"An event source is any object which can generate events. For example, an ALLEGRO_DISPLAY can generate events, and you can get the ALLEGRO_EVENT_SOURCE pointer from an ALLEGRO_DISPLAY with al_get_display_event_source.\n\nYou may create your own ""user"" event sources that emit custom events.",INFORM,,,concepts patterns,,
10,15,Programmer,Please tell me more about ALlERGO_EVENT_KEY events,ELICIT-INFORM,,,basic,,
11,16,Apiza,"There are three different types of EVENT_KEY events: ALLEGRO_EVENT_KEY_DOWN, ALLEGRO_EVENT_KEY_UP, and ALLEGRO_EVENT_KEY_CHAR",INFORM,,,structure,,
12,17,Programmer,Is there allergo_event key left and key right,ELICIT-INFORM,,,structure,,
13,18,Apiza,I found two Key codes: ALLEGRO_KEY_LEFT and ALLEGRO_KEY_RIGHT. ,INFORM,,,structure patterns,,
13,19,Apiza,These can be used with keyboard routines such as al_key_down,INFORM,,,structure patterns,,
14,20,Programmer,Tell me more about al_key routines,ELICIT-INFORM,,,structure basic,,
15,21,Apiza,There are 9 functions directly relating to the keyboard:\n\nal_install_keyboard\nal_is_keyboard_installed\nal_uninstall_keyboard\nal_get_keyboard_state\nal_clear_keyboard_state\nal_key_down\nal_keycode_to_name\nal_set_keyboard_leds\nal_get_keyboard_event_source,INFORM,,,structure,,

19,27,Programmer,Yes,INFORM,,,patterns,,
20,28,Apiza,Sure thing! ,BE-POSITIVE,,,examples,,
20,29,Apiza,It looks like this is how you could load and play an audio file:\n\n\n ,SUGGEST,,,examples,,
20,30,Apiza,"ALLEGRO_SAMPLE *sample=NULL;\n\t\n if(!al_install_audio()){\n fprintf(stderr, ""failed to initialize audio!\\n"");\n return -1;\n }\n\t\n if (!al_reserve_samples(1)){\n fprintf(stderr, ""failed to reserve samples!\\n"");\n return -1;\n }\n\t\n sample = al_load_sample( ""footstep.wav"" );\n\n if (!sample){\n printf( ""Audio clip sample not loaded!\\n"" );\n return -1;\n }\n\n al_play_sample(sample, 1.0, 0.0,1.0,ALLEGRO_PLAYMODE_LOOP,NULL);\n\t\n al_destroy_sample(sample);",INFORM,,,examples,,

23,35,Apiza,"Returns the sample on success, NULL on failure.",INFORM,,,functionality basic,,
24,36,Apiza,"For sample-loading errors, it look like you may need to initialize the ""audio codec add-on"". Use `al_init_acodec_addon()` to initialize the audio codec.",SUGGEST,,,patterns,,
