On the last task now, but quick question - can I ask questions in parallel? There's a little lag between the question and answer.

Oh apologies, just saw this message! Yeah, you can ask questions in parallel, they will be processed in order

No problem, glad I could help. It was actually kinda cool what it can do, surprised the heck outta me!

Unrelated technical question: what's its scope? Can I ask it any math question, or theorem, or API?
