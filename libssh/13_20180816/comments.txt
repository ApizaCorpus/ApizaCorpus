Alright, you can find a good stopping point!

Thanks for your work! How did it go?

I think at first I was a little slow out of the gate, specifically from a lack of available examples and no prior experience creating this type of program. As I went on I started to work better, I think I was understanding better how to approach this by the end.
I think in the middle there were more examples in the answers I was receiving from Apiza, and I understood better how to ask it questions

I think that I initially didn't realize how much information Apiza could give me in terms of asking it about parameters required for functions

All done,

I would say the speed of responses was the main reason for some of my lower scores, it felt like it was a bit on the slow side, but ultimately helpful.
