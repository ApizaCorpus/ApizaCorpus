The apiza react slow tbh

is that normal?
I probably need to wait a while for Apiza answer my question

It is little slow to wait for the results come from Apiza

but it is pretty helpful with API

however if it can react in 1s that would be a lot more helpful

Thank you!

no problem
The only part is the react time frustrating
also if the API text can be highlighted would be more helpful
