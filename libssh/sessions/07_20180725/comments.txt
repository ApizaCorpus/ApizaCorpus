If ask multiple questions in a row will it respond to each one or just the "last" one?

Zack [6:02 PM]
It will tackle them in order, feel free to do so

Programmer_7 [6:02 PM]
Cool
How should I proceed if I can't figure out the proper question to ask for a particular task?
Cant get it to respond to setting host

Zack [6:10 PM]
Right, has apiza suggested the method "ssh_options_set" yet?

Programmer_7 [6:10 PM]
No, I haven't been able to trigger it with the right question

Zack [6:11 PM]
That's alright, that's what we're hoping to improve :slightly_smiling_face:

I'd suggest asking about ssh_options_set directly

Programmer_7 [6:12 PM]
Hmm... it gives me the function signature, but I can't get it to give me a list of the option values

Zack [6:14 PM]
Strange, shouldn't have too much trouble with that. Keep communicating and see if it will deliver
