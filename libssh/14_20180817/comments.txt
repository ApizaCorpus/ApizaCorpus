the help is too slow ..

It takes a lot of time to search and reply ..
it takes 1-2 min to reply to a query ..
And I didn't know like what kind of queries I could ask the assistant

Definitely, the process is unoptimized, this technology would need to be way snappier in a commercial product

May be if you could post example converstaions with Apiza before taking the session it would have been great
I mostly avoided google and was just trying to test Apiza

That's a good point! These are early tests, so we've been interested to see how programmers would organically interact without being given specific prompts

But initially it gave me a deprecated example code of server authentication .. which cost me lot of time
no I did not use google at all
