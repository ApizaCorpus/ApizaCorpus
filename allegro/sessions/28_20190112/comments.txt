Alright, you can come to a stopping point!
How did it go?

ok, yeah I am at a stopping point. I think it well, I did not complete as many tasks as I would have liked but I finished steps 1-3
I was impressed with Apiza

when I said "nevermind" the last time, I noticed that I was drawing the text after flipping the delay. I have not used Allegro before but I am familiar with game programming and realized that I was probably drawing the text after the buffers were already swapped

Other than the delay, I think Apiza is a nicer way to discover the API, because it gives common suggestions, it's less work of scanning online docs

ok, I just did the survey. I think it was pretty powerful. I really liked that I could ask about a topic like "how do I play an audio file" and then it gives the basic setup and after I do that work, I can simply say "what's next". That is really nice because most APIs have multiple ceremonies you have to do to get something working

The speed was the only thing frustrating to me; but I guess more GPUs can fix that. :slightly_smiling_face:    It was nice that I did not have to curate my questions carefully for the machine
