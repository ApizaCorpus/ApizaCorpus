Hello Apiza


Apiza [4:11 PM]
Hi! Iâ€™m Apiza, a virtual assistant designed to help you use a new API. How can I help you?

Programmer_16 [4:15 PM]
How do I get keyboard events
How do I register keyboard events?
Apiza are you there
@Apiza do you hear me
How do I register keyboard events with allegro?

Apiza [4:18 PM]
Something like ALLEGRO_EVENT_KEY_DOWN? If you have an event
```ev```
, you can check the value of
```ev.keyboard.keycode```
.
You do not need to specifically register the keyboard, though it should be installed with
```bool al_install_keyboard(void)```

Programmer_16 [4:27 PM]
What header do i need to include for the allegro key events
?

Apiza [4:28 PM]
Events and keyboard input are included in the allegro.h header.

Programmer_16 [4:29 PM]
What are the allegro event key right and allegro event key left variables called

Apiza [4:30 PM]
ALLEGRO_KEY_LEFT and ALLEGRO_KEY_RIGHT are key codes, which are returned in the event.keyboard.keycode field of the ALLEGRO_KEY_DOWN and ALLEGRO_KEY_UP events.

Programmer_16 [4:36 PM]
how to pop elements off the allegro event queue

Apiza [4:37 PM]
The function

```void al_wait_for_event(ALLEGRO_EVENT_QUEUE *queue, ALLEGRO_EVENT *ret_event)```    

Description: Wait until the event queue specified is non-empty. If ret_event is not NULL, the first event in the queue will be copied into ret_event and removed from the queue. If ret_event is NULL the first event is left at the head of the queue.

Programmer_16 [4:40 PM]
Is there a timeout to wait for an event?

Apiza [4:42 PM]
Do either of these functions look useful?

```bool al_wait_for_event_timed(ALLEGRO_EVENT_QUEUE *queue,
   ALLEGRO_EVENT *ret_event, float secs)```

```bool al_wait_for_event_until(ALLEGRO_EVENT_QUEUE *queue,
   ALLEGRO_EVENT *ret_event, ALLEGRO_TIMEOUT *timeout)```

Programmer_16 [4:43 PM]
What is ALLEGRO_TIMEOUT

Apiza [4:44 PM]
ALLEGRO_TIMEOUT

```typedef struct ALLEGRO_TIMEOUT ALLEGRO_TIMEOUT;```

Represent a timeout value. The size of the structure is known so it can be statically allocated. The contents are private.

Initialized with

```void al_init_timeout(ALLEGRO_TIMEOUT *timeout, double seconds)```

Programmer_16 [4:45 PM]
what is the function signature of al_get_timer_event_source

Apiza [4:45 PM]
```void al_set_timer_speed(ALLEGRO_TIMER *timer, double new_speed_secs)```
Correction:
```ALLEGRO_EVENT_SOURCE *al_get_timer_event_source(ALLEGRO_TIMER *timer)```

Programmer_16 [4:47 PM]
please provide more information about al_wait_for_event_timed

Apiza [4:48 PM]
al_wait_for_event_timed:

Wait until the event queue specified is non-empty. If ret_event is not NULL, the first event in the queue will be copied into ret_event and removed from the queue. If ret_event is NULL the first event is left at the head of the queue.

secs determines approximately how many seconds to wait. If the call times out, false is returned. Otherwise, if an event ocurred, true is returned.

For compatibility with all platforms, secs must be 2,147,483.647 seconds or less.

Programmer_16 [4:54 PM]
what are all the possible allegro event types?
What are the allegro keyboard input event types

Apiza [4:56 PM]
There are about 27 event types, related to KEY, MOUSE, JOYSTICK, TIME, DISPLAY, and TOUCH. The event types related to Key Events are ALLEGRO_EVENT_KEY_DOWN and ALLEGRO_EVENT_KEY_UP.
The event types related to Key Events are ALLEGRO_EVENT_KEY_DOWN and ALLEGRO_EVENT_KEY_UP.

how to play a sound with allegro'
How to play a sound with Allegro?

Apiza [5:05 PM]
The simplest method is al_play_sample

```bool al_play_sample(ALLEGRO_SAMPLE *spl, float gain, float pan, float speed,
   ALLEGRO_PLAYMODE loop, ALLEGRO_SAMPLE_ID *ret_id)```

Plays a sample on one of the sample instances created by al_reserve_samples. Returns true on success, false on failure. Playback may fail because all the reserved sample instances are currently used.

Programmer_16 [5:06 PM]
What is ALLEGRO_PLAYMODE
What is ALLEGRO_SAMPLE_ID

Apiza [5:07 PM]
That refers to an enum. Options are ALLEGRO_PLAYMODE_ONCE, ALLEGRO_PLAYMODE_LOOP, or ALLEGRO_PLAYMODE_BIDIR
Regarding ALLEGRO_SAMPLE_ID variable ret_id - if non-NULL the variable which this points to will be assigned an id representing the sample being played. If al_play_sample returns  false, then the contents of ret_id are invalid and must not be used as argument to other functions.
I was able to find an example function call:

```al_play_sample(sample, 1.0, 0.0,1.0,ALLEGRO_PLAYMODE_LOOP,NULL);```

Programmer_16 [5:09 PM]
What is an ALLEGRO_SAMPLE

Apiza [5:10 PM]
An ALLEGRO_SAMPLE object stores the data necessary for playing pre-defined digital audio. It holds a user-specified PCM data buffer and information about its format (data length, depth, frequency, channel configuration). You can have the same ALLEGRO_SAMPLE playing multiple times simultaneously.

Samples are often initialized with the function al_load_sample:

```ALLEGRO_SAMPLE *al_load_sample(const char *filename)```

Programmer_16 [5:12 PM]
how to free pointers allegro
how to free ALLEGRO_SAMPLE

Apiza [5:12 PM]
The function al_destroy_sample should work:

```void al_destroy_sample(ALLEGRO_SAMPLE *spl)```

Programmer_16 [5:16 PM]
al_load_sample is returning NULL

Apiza [5:17 PM]
It looks like al_load_sample only returns NULL on failure. Could I see how you are calling the function?

Programmer_16 [5:17 PM]
spl = al_load_sample( AUDIO_SAMPLE_PATH );

Apiza [5:19 PM]
If AUDIO_SAMPLE_PATH is a valid path, this call should return a sample.
There a couple of other reasons this function might not work. Have you called al_install_audio() and al_init_acodec_addon()?

Programmer_16 [5:19 PM]
finction signature for al_install_audio()
function signature for al_init_acodec_addon()

Apiza [5:20 PM]
```bool al_install_audio(void)```
```bool al_init_acodec_addon(void)```
If it helps, I was able to extract the following example that should Play an audio file.

```ALLEGRO_SAMPLE *sample=NULL;

...

if(!al_install_audio()){
      fprintf(stderr, "failed to initialize audio!\n");
      return -1;
}

if(!al_init_acodec_addon()){
      fprintf(stderr, "failed to initialize audio codecs!\n");
      return -1;
}
    
if (!al_reserve_samples(1)){
      fprintf(stderr, "failed to reserve samples!\n");
      return -1;
}

...
    
sample = al_load_sample( "footstep.wav" );

...

al_play_sample(sample, 1.0, 0.0,1.0,ALLEGRO_PLAYMODE_LOOP,NULL);```

how to display text with allegro

Apiza [5:27 PM]
There are several functions to display text, the simplest is al_draw_text

```void al_draw_text(const ALLEGRO_FONT *font,
   ALLEGRO_COLOR color, float x, float y, int flags,
   char const *text)``` 

Writes the NUL-terminated string text onto the target bitmap at position  x, y, using the specified font.

The flags parameter can be 0 or one of the following flags:

ALLEGRO_ALIGN_LEFT - Draw the text left-aligned (same as 0).
ALLEGRO_ALIGN_CENTRE - Draw the text centered around the given position.
ALLEGRO_ALIGN_RIGHT - Draw the text right-aligned to the given position.
It can also be combined with this flag:

ALLEGRO_ALIGN_INTEGER - Always draw text aligned to an integer pixel position. This was formerly the default behaviour. Since: 5.0.8, 5.1.4
This function does not support newline characters (\n), but you can use al_draw_multiline_text for multi line text output.

Programmer_16 [5:28 PM]
load ALLEGRO_FONT
load ALLEGRO_COLOR

Apiza [5:29 PM]
This function should work:

```ALLEGRO_FONT *al_load_font(char const *filename, int size, int flags)```
I could not find a function to load ALLEGRO_COLOR, but there are several functions that take primitive parameters and return ALLEGRO_COLOR, such as

```ALLEGRO_COLOR al_color_cmyk(float c, float m, float y, float k)```

Programmer_16 [5:32 PM]
al_load_font flags
more information about al_load_font please
more information about al_color_cmyk please

Apiza [5:33 PM]
Sure thing!

```ALLEGRO_FONT *al_load_font(char const *filename, int size, int flags)```

Loads a font from disk. This will use al_load_bitmap_font_flags if you pass the name of a known bitmap format, or else al_load_ttf_font.

The flags parameter is passed through to either of those functions. Bitmap and TTF fonts are also affected by the current bitmap flags at the time the font is loaded.
```ALLEGRO_COLOR al_color_cmyk(float c, float m, float y, float k)```

Return an ALLEGRO_COLOR structure from CMYK values (cyan, magenta, yellow, black).
Would you like me to list all of the functions related to ALLEGRO_COLOR?

Programmer_16 [5:36 PM]
