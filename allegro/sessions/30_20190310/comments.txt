Perfect! There weren't any comment boxes on the survey, but if you do have any specific comments or thoughts on the experience programming with Apiza, I'd love to hear them

I thought that Apiza was surprisingly effective at answering my questions. Initially, I had assumed that Apiza would be on the same level as things like Siri, or Alexa.
