Hi Apiza


Apiza [9:16 PM]
Hello! I am Apiza, a virtual assistant designed to help you navigate and use APIs. How can I help?

What is the definition of structure of ALLERGO_EVENT
?

Apiza [9:18 PM]
I found the following description for ALLEGRO_EVENT:

An ALLEGRO_EVENT is a union of all builtin event structures, i.e. it is an object large enough to hold the data of any event type. All events have the following fields in common:

type (ALLEGRO_EVENT_TYPE)
    Indicates the type of event.
any.source (ALLEGRO_EVENT_SOURCE *)
    The event source which generated the event.
any.timestamp (double)
    When the event was generated.

Programmer_15 [9:19 PM]
What are the possible values for ALLERGO_EVENT_TYPE
And ALLERGO_EVENT_SOURCE

Apiza [9:20 PM]
ALLERGO_EVENT_TYPE is an enum with several values, including ALLEGRO_EVENT_JOYSTICK_AXIS , ALLEGRO_EVENT_KEY_DOWN   , and ALLEGRO_EVENT_MOUSE_AXES. There are 30 different values in total. Are you looking for one type in particular?
I found the following description of ALLEGRO_EVENT_SOURCE:

An event source is any object which can generate events. For example, an ALLEGRO_DISPLAY can generate events, and you can get the ALLEGRO_EVENT_SOURCE pointer from an ALLEGRO_DISPLAY with al_get_display_event_source.

You may create your own "user" event sources that emit custom events.

Programmer_15 [9:26 PM]
Please tell me more about ALlERGO_EVENT_KEY events

Apiza [9:27 PM]
There are three different types of EVENT_KEY events: ALLEGRO_EVENT_KEY_DOWN, ALLEGRO_EVENT_KEY_UP, and ALLEGRO_EVENT_KEY_CHAR

Programmer_15 [9:28 PM]
Is there allergo_event key left and key right

Apiza [9:30 PM]
I found two Key codes: ALLEGRO_KEY_LEFT and ALLEGRO_KEY_RIGHT. These can be used with keyboard routines such as al_key_down

Programmer_15 [9:34 PM]
Tell me more about al_key routines

Apiza [9:36 PM]
There are 9 functions directly relating to the keyboard:

al_install_keyboard
al_is_keyboard_installed
al_uninstall_keyboard
al_get_keyboard_state
al_clear_keyboard_state
al_key_down
al_keycode_to_name
al_set_keyboard_leds
al_get_keyboard_event_source

Programmer_15 [9:38 PM]
What function plays an audio file?

Apiza [9:40 PM]
There are many function related to Audio playback. al_play_sample plays a given ALLEGRO_SAMPLE.
bool al_play_sample(ALLEGRO_SAMPLE *spl, float gain, float pan, float speed,
  ALLEGRO_PLAYMODE loop, ALLEGRO_SAMPLE_ID *ret_id)
Would you like help loading and playing an ALLEGRO_SAMPLE?

Programmer_15 [9:43 PM]
Yes

Apiza [9:45 PM]
Sure thing! It looks like this is how you could load and play an audio file:


  ALLEGRO_SAMPLE *sample=NULL;
    
  if(!al_install_audio()){
     fprintf(stderr, "failed to initialize audio!\n");
     return -1;
  }
    
  if (!al_reserve_samples(1)){
     fprintf(stderr, "failed to reserve samples!\n");
     return -1;
  }
    
  sample = al_load_sample( "footstep.wav" );

  if (!sample){
     printf( "Audio clip sample not loaded!\n" );
     return -1;
  }

  al_play_sample(sample, 1.0, 0.0,1.0,ALLEGRO_PLAYMODE_LOOP,NULL);
    
  al_destroy_sample(sample);

Programmer_15 [10:00 PM]
Why is allergo sample* mistaken as int*
What does the function al_load_sample return

Apiza [10:01 PM]
The al_load_sample function looks like this: ALLEGRO_SAMPLE *al_load_sample(const char *filename)

Returns the sample on success, NULL on failure.
For sample-loading errors, it look like you may need to initialize the "audio codec add-on". Use `al_init_acodec_addon()` to initialize the audio codec.

Programmer_15 [10:12 PM]
Can you help me with fuctions that draw bitmap

Apiza [10:13 PM]
I'm happy to help! Where would you like to start with bitmap drawing?

Programmer_15 [10:13 PM]
I want to draw a png

Apiza [10:15 PM]
Alright, the variable that you will need to initialize is an ALLEGRO_BITMAP. You can do so with the function al_create_bitmap: ALLEGRO_BITMAP *al_create_bitmap(int w, int h)

Programmer_15 [10:16 PM]
What function takes a png file as input and draws a bitmap?

Apiza [10:16 PM]
ALLEGRO_BITMAP *al_load_bitmap(const char *filename)

Loads an image file into a new ALLEGRO_BITMAP. The file type is determined by the extension, except if the file has no extension in which case al_identify_bitmap is used instead.

Returns NULL on error.

Programmer_15 [10:20 PM]
Load bitmap returns null

Apiza [10:22 PM]
If you're getting errors loading an image, you may need to initialize the "image addon." You can do this using al_init_image_addon()

Programmer_15 [10:35 PM]
Image not displayed event after loading the png in bitmap?

Apiza [10:36 PM]
Sorry, could you rephrase your question?
