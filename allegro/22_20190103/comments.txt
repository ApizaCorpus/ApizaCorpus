Those are all numerical questions in the survey. If you have any other feedback, I'd love to hear it here!

So, some my additional comments: reading headers would be faster and easily at least for me. But I'm really impressing how system was understanding my requests.

If a system like this were to be used alongside regular documentation (instead of completely replacing it), are there any specific features you would expect or want to see in it?

it would nice to have some pre-session before this task, it would allow me to understand how to interact with it.
Also, some command like example <function>, doc <function> would be more faster than "show me example of <function>" :slightly_smiling_face:

Haha, that's a good point, thank you!
