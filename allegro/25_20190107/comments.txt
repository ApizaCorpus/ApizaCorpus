In addition to those questions, I'd like to hear any comments you have on Apiza (any specific improvements you would suggest, cases where you think it would be more or less useful, etc.)

okay, I think it was a good experience, But it lacks the ability to answer some specific questions
It is very good replacement of the api documentation
If you could implement examples/code snippets in Apiza
it would be awesome
however, It is absolutely faster to learn and most of the time it correctly points you to all the things required to do a task

That definitely makes sense, thank you :slightly_smiling_face:
