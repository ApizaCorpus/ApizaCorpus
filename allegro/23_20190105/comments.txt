Great, thank you! There weren't any comment boxes in the survey, but if you have any comments, I'd love to hear them

ok, so first and foremost it's quite slow and that makes it unusable, but I guess you already know that
if you don't take the slow part into account
I think it biggest issue is that it seems to only talk about one api call about a time
at some point it would be nice if it could return a list of a bunch of possible ideas
Also I didn't knew that it will keep making different suggestions when I answered 'no' when it asked if I wanted to know about XX function
for example here:

Ah

Programmer_23 [12:52 PM]
I had already hear about al_play_sample and that wasn't what I wanted
I just answered no in frustration, but it actually followed up with the function that I did wanted
I wasn't expecting that
I was expecting 'no' to basically stop the iteraction

Zack [12:55 PM]
Gotcha. Were you pleasantly surprised when it followed up with the right function, or was it off-putting? (Or something else?)

Programmer_23 [12:56 PM]
I was pleasantly surprised as at that point I was already going to lockup the header files
I guess I was frustrated that it wasn't easier to figure out that if I answered no it would keep suggesting alternatives
so mixed feelings :slightly_smiling_face:

Zack [12:57 PM]
Understood, thank you! That is very valuable feedback.

Programmer_23 [12:58 PM]
Also I was frustrated that I already asked these questions:
how do I get an ALLEGRO_SAMPLE
how do I load a sample from a file ?
how to load a wav file?
how to load a sample from a wav?
and it never pointed me to al_load_sample

Zack [1:00 PM]
Oh, yeah, that would definitely be frustrating. Thank you for putting up with it! :slightly_smiling_face:

Programmer_23 [1:01 PM]
anyway, that was a fun experiment :slightly_smiling_face:
