            "text": "It will take the following if you pass the name of a known bitmap format:\n\nALLEGRO_NO_PREMULTIPLIED_ALPHA\nBy default, Allegro pre-multiplies the alpha channel of an image with the images color data when it loads it. Typically that would look something like this:\n\nr = get_float_byte();\ng = get_float_byte();\nb = get_float_byte();\na = get_float_byte();\n\nr = r * a;\ng = g * a;\nb = b * a;\n\nset_image_pixel(x, y, r, g, b, a);\nThe reason for this can be seen in the Allegro example ex_premulalpha, ie, using pre-multiplied alpha gives more accurate color results in some cases. To use alpha blending with images loaded with pre-multiplied alpha, you would use the default blending mode, which is set with al_set_blender(ALLEGRO_ADD, ALLEGRO_ONE, ALLEGRO_INVERSE_ALPHA).\n\nThe ALLEGRO_NO_PREMULTIPLIED_ALPHA flag being set will ensure that images are not loaded with alpha pre-multiplied, but are loaded with color values direct from the image. That looks like this:\n\nr = get_float_byte();\ng = get_float_byte();\nb = get_float_byte();\na = get_float_byte();\n\nset_image_pixel(x, y, r, g, b, a);\nTo draw such an image using regular alpha blending, you would use al_set_blender(ALLEGRO_ADD, ALLEGRO_ALPHA, ALLEGRO_INVERSE_ALPHA) to set the correct blender. This has some caveats. First, as mentioned above, drawing such an image can result in less accurate color blending (when drawing an image with linear filtering on, the edges will be darker than they should be). Second, the behaviour is somewhat confusing, which is explained in the example below.\n\n\/\/ Load and create bitmaps with an alpha channel\nal_set_new_bitmap_format(ALLEGRO_PIXEL_FORMAT_ANY_32_WITH_ALPHA);\n\/\/ Load some bitmap with alpha in it\nbmp = al_load_bitmap(\"some_alpha_bitmap.png\");\n\/\/ We will draw to this buffer and then draw this buffer to the screen\ntmp_buffer = al_create_bitmap(SCREEN_W, SCREEN_H);\n\/\/ Set the buffer as the target and clear it\nal_set_target_bitmap(tmp_buffer);\nal_clear_to_color(al_map_rgba_f(0, 0, 0, 1));\n\/\/ Draw the bitmap to the temporary buffer\nal_draw_bitmap(bmp, 0, 0, 0);\n\/\/ Finally, draw the buffer to the screen\n\/\/ The output will look incorrect (may take close inspection\n\/\/ depending on the bitmap -- it may also be very obvious)\nal_set_target_bitmap(al_get_backbuffer(display));\nal_draw_bitmap(tmp_buffer, 0, 0, 0);\nTo explain further, if you have a pixel with 0.5 alpha, and you're using (ALLEGRO_ADD, ALLEGRO_ALPHA, ALLEGRO_INVERSE_ALPHA) for blending, the formula is:\n\na = da * dst + sa * src\nExpands to:\n\nresult_a = dst_a * (1-0.5) + 0.5 * 0.5\nSo if you draw the image to the temporary buffer, it is blended once resulting in 0.75 alpha, then drawn again to the screen, blended in the same way, resulting in a pixel has 0.1875 as an alpha value.\n\nOtherwise it will use the following:\n\nALLEGRO_TTF_NO_KERNING - Do not use any kerning even if the font file supports it.\n\nALLEGRO_TTF_MONOCHROME - Load as a monochrome font (which means no anti-aliasing of the font is done).\n\nALLEGRO_TTF_NO_AUTOHINT - Disable the Auto Hinter which is enabled by default in newer versions of FreeType.
